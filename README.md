This repository contains a Go-based implementation of an API server that
implements the discovery service APIs defined in
[data-plane-api](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api).

## Scope

Due to the variety of platforms out there, there is no single
control plane implementation that can satisfy everyone's needs. Hence this
code base does not attempt to be a full scale control plane for a fleet of
Envoy proxies. Instead, it provides infrastructure that is shared by
multiple different control plane implementations. The components provided
by this library are:

* _API Server:_ A generic gRPC based API server that implements xDS APIs as defined
  in the
  [data-plane-api](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api). The API
  server is responsible for pushing configuration updates to
  Envoys. Consumers should be able to import this go library and use the
  API server as is, in production deployments.

* _Configuration Cache:_ The library will cache Envoy configurations in
memory in an attempt to provide fast response to consumer Envoys. It is the
responsibility of the consumer of this library to populate the cache as
well as invalidate it when necessary. The cache will be keyed based on a
pre-defined hash function whose keys are based on the
[Node information](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api/blob/d4988844024d0bcff4bcd030552eabe3396203fa/api/base.proto#L26-L36).

At this moment, this repository will not tackle translating platform
specific representation of resources (e.g., services, instances of
services, etc.) into Envoy-style configuration. Based on usage and
feedback, we might decided to revisit this aspect at a later point in time.

## Requirements

1. Go 1.12+

## Quick start

It's recommended to run the command with script `./build/run_docker.sh` as it executes the command
in the same environment as the circle ci. This makes sure to produce a consistent set of generated files.

1. Setup existing build:

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make build test
    ```

1. Generate proto files (if you update the [data-plane-api](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api)
dependency)

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make generate
    ```

    __NOTE__: you may need to apply a small patch to correct imports in the generate files:

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make generate-patch
    ```

    Format the code:

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make format
    ```

    Run build and unit tests again:

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make build test
    ```

1. Run [integration test](pkg/test/main/README.md) against the latest Envoy binary:

    ```sh
    ./build/run_docker.sh make integration
    ```

## Usage

Register services on the gRPC server as follows.

```go
import (
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"net"

	api "github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/envoy/api/v2"
	discovery "github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/envoy/service/discovery/v2"
	"github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/pkg/cache"
	xds "github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/pkg/server"
)

func main() {
	snapshotCache := cache.NewSnapshotCache(false, cache.IDHash{}, nil)
	server := xds.NewServer(snapshotCache, nil)
	grpcServer := grpc.NewServer()
	lis, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")

	discovery.RegisterAggregatedDiscoveryServiceServer(grpcServer, server)
	api.RegisterEndpointDiscoveryServiceServer(grpcServer, server)
	api.RegisterClusterDiscoveryServiceServer(grpcServer, server)
	api.RegisterRouteDiscoveryServiceServer(grpcServer, server)
	api.RegisterListenerDiscoveryServiceServer(grpcServer, server)
	go func() {
		if err := grpcServer.Serve(lis); err != nil {
			// error handling
		}
	}()
}
```

As mentioned in [Scope](https://github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/blob/master/README.md#scope), you need to cache Envoy configurations.
Generate the key based on the node information as follows and cache the configurations.

```go
import "github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/pkg/cache"

var clusters, endpoints, routes, listeners []cache.Resource

snapshotCache := cache.NewSnapshotCache(false, cache.IDHash{}, nil)
snapshot := cache.NewSnapshot("1.0", endpoints, clusters, routes, listeners)
_ = snapshotCache.SetSnapshot("node1", snapshot)
```

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
